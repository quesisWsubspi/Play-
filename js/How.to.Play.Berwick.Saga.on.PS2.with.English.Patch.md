Berwick Saga is a tactical RPG game for the PlayStation 2 that was released in Japan in 2005. It is the sequel to Tear Ring Saga, a game created by Shouzou Kaga, the original creator of Fire Emblem.

Unfortunately, Berwick Saga was never officially localized or released outside of Japan. However, thanks to the efforts of a fan translation team led by Aethin, an English patch for the game is now available. The patch translates all the text in the game into English, making it accessible to a wider audience of RPG fans.
 
In this article, we will show you how to play Berwick Saga on PS2 with the English patch. You will need the following items:
 
- A PS2 console that can play Japanese games (either modded or with a swap disc)
- A Japanese copy of Berwick Saga (either physical or ISO)
- A USB flash drive or memory card
- A computer with internet access
- The English patch files from [serenesforest.net](https://serenesforest.net/forums/index.php?/topic/85081-berwick-saga-fan-translation-project/)

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the English patch files from [serenesforest.net](https://serenesforest.net/forums/index.php?/topic/85081-berwick-saga-fan-translation-project/) and extract them to a folder on your computer.
2. Copy the folder named "Berwick" to your USB flash drive or memory card.
3. If you have a physical copy of Berwick Saga, insert it into your PS2 console. If you have an ISO file of Berwick Saga, burn it to a DVD-R disc using a program like ImgBurn.
4. Insert your USB flash drive or memory card into your PS2 console.
5. Boot up your PS2 console and launch Berwick Saga using your preferred method (modchip, swap disc, etc.).
6. When the game starts, press Start to skip the opening movie. You will see a message saying "Press L1+R1+Select+Start". Do so to open the patch menu.
7. Select "Load Patch" and then select your USB flash drive or memory card as the source. The patch will load automatically and you will see a message saying "Patch Loaded". Press Circle to return to the game.
8. Enjoy playing Berwick Saga in English!

Note: The patch is compatible with both NTSC-J and PAL versions of Berwick Saga. However, if you are playing on a PAL console, you may experience some graphical glitches due to the difference in resolution. To fix this, you can use a program like GSM to force the game to run in NTSC mode.
  
Now that you have successfully patched and loaded Berwick Saga in English, you may be wondering how to play this game effectively. Berwick Saga is a very different game from Fire Emblem and even Tear Ring Saga, and it has many unique mechanics and features that may confuse or challenge new players. Here are some tips to help you get started:

- Pay attention to the terrain. Terrain affects not only movement and evasion, but also accuracy, damage, and critical rate. For example, forests give +10% accuracy and +5% damage to axe users, while plains give +10% accuracy and +5% damage to lance users. You can check the terrain effects by pressing Square on any tile.
- Use the free cursor. You can move the cursor freely around the map by pressing R1 or L1. This allows you to check enemy stats, equipment, skills, and movement range. You can also check the turn order by pressing Triangle, which shows you who will act next and in what order.
- Manage your weapons and items. Unlike Fire Emblem, weapons and items in Berwick Saga do not have durability, but they have weight and quality. Weight affects your speed and evasion, while quality affects your accuracy and damage. You can repair your weapons and items at shops or blacksmiths, but it costs money and time. You can also buy new weapons and items at shops or from merchants that visit your base.
- Use skills wisely. Skills are special abilities that characters can learn or inherit from their classes. Skills can be activated manually or automatically depending on the type and situation. Some skills are very powerful, such as Dean's Charge or Sherlock's Snipe, but they have limited uses per map or per chapter. You can check your skills by pressing Circle on any character.
- Explore the side missions. Berwick Saga has many side missions that you can access by visiting various locations on the world map. Side missions offer extra rewards, such as money, items, weapons, or new characters. Some side missions are hidden or have special requirements to unlock them. You can also replay some side missions as many times as you want.

Berwick Saga is a deep and complex game that offers a lot of replay value and customization options. It may seem daunting at first, but once you get used to its mechanics and systems, you will find a rewarding and enjoyable experience. Have fun playing Berwick Saga!
